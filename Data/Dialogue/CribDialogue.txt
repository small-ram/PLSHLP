 The baby’s crying. 

Screaming in her crib. She’s so small. 

You have just fed her with a precisely measured dose of formula and changed her diaper. What more does she want? 

What should you do?


1) Nothing 

	-- In Korea they believe that a newborn baby does not actually cry. In an ancient language, it implores: 'Please save me.' You never even tried to. Why? 

Please help me understand.


2) Something

	-- You check The Book again. „Care for the mental development of the child at three months. If the baby still cries, after it has been fed and changed, it is not advisable to comfort it. We would be raising a selfish, spoiled child.“ 

I bought the book recently, hoping it will help me understand.
