1)Remaining optional enhancements
Resolution / aspect scaling – Convert hard-coded coordinates to anchored Control nodes or percent-based layouts.

Audio overlap – Switch AudioManager to a one-shot-player pool if simultaneous snaps, hover sounds, etc. are desired.

Content externalisation – Move intro lines and woman phrases to JSON or CSV for localisation.

Accessibility – Keyboard navigation for intro and dialog choices; toggle for reduced motion.

QA tooling – expose a debug flag that lets ButtonBar skip to any stage, spawn SFX test, etc.








2)Layout – In Main.tscn, wrap PhotoStack in a right-anchored MarginContainer. Then set each photo’s position relative to that container (e.g., (0,0), (0,250)), so it adapts to resolution changes.
3) Make bin delete photos
4) Hover highlight	Make the bin brighten when a draggable photo is picked up during Stage 4.	Add a Tween in TrashCan.gd and connect Photo.drag_started/ended or let StageController broadcast a custom signal.
Sound slot	Give the scene an AudioStreamPlayer child pre-set with the “crumple” sound so you don’t need to spawn one each time in code.


5) Add moving parts
6) Add puzzle
7) add mmmore photos 
8) add dialogues to the photos
